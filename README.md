### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here is a little Information About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Jr Developer with experience in JavaScript, Mongo DB, React, Redux, Bootstrap, CSS, and SASS. I enjoy building applications and web services that are user-friendly and efficient. I have worked on several personal projects that have given me hands-on experience with these technologies and have helped me sharpen my skills.

I am a quick learner and problem solver, always striving to learn new technologies and apply them to real-world projects. My experience as a Full Stack Jr Developer has given me a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to contribute to all stages of the development process.

I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a keen eye for detail. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code that is easy to understand and modify. My personal projects have given me experience in working collaboratively with a team, as well as independently managing projects from start to finish.

Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've worked on recently:

Pokedex built with React and Node.js,

The Pokedex allows users to search for Pokemon by name or number, and provides detailed information on each Pokemon's type, moves, and abilities. Users can also create new Pokemon, customizing their appearance and stats.

Medilab Manager.

Is a laboratory test buying platform we developed included a search feature that allowed users to browse through different types of laboratory tests, and a detailed description of each test. We also provided a shopping cart feature where users could add multiple tests and checkout together. The web-page also had an appointment scheduling feature where users could select their preferred date and time to take the tests. Finally, we implemented a secure payment gateway to ensure the safety of transactions.

#Coding Philosophy

I believe in writing clean, efficient code that is easy to maintain and understand. I prefer to work with JavaScrip, and I'm a fan of the Agile development methodology.

Goals

In the long term, I hope to continue working on projects that make a positive impact on people's lives. I'm particularly interested in exploring new technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I'm excited to see how they can be applied to real-world problems.
